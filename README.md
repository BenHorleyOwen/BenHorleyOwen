# Things I want to make; (internal project numbers)

### personal selfhost website (11, 21, 22, 25, 26, 42):
- foundational project that I want to be able to run/host/showoff all my future creations through
- should contain a repository of all of the invention numbers, including noncode ones (which are excluded from here: 2,3,4,5,6,12,16. etc)

### receipt scan database for automated dietry information (23):
- create an agent which can scan through a reciept, check it against present spreadsheet entries and potentially keep moer whilst logging neutritional and spending habits.

### photodiode laser microphone (1):
- this is for the challenge of making it

### LED compass, integrated to calendar and google maps (7):
- this is for the challenge of making it

### Network access point house device room map (9, 11):
- devices typically connect to the strongest access point so a house with one in each room could have a map built based off network connection logs
- this could be further be improved by allowing things like music services which are tied to each device to follow someone around the house

### advanced bookshelf, ocr read into database, projector show on shelf (10):
- a bookshelf which uses a projector and informaiton on all the books to find the best way to store them on a small scale, whilst also being able to help locate books by lighlighting them


### drone swarm project (17, 39):
- (17) webcam attached drone which has a rest state that attaches to pc/ derma stand and an active state where it can fly around the room like one of those ancient hand pixie toys but can keep computer signal
- (39) drone array neural network, space time spreadsheet plotter. additional complexity: spread, speed, swooping

### neural network trained off my own brain patterns as a foundation for other fun things (14, 28):
- 

### basic honeypot (18):
- nginx, ngrok, cowry docker container as a fake exposed ssh container

### keyboard driver to show keybind combos:
- 

### digial journal backup (20):
- extensive backup, find a way to mount the output eventually
- current tool used for it only does full backups, wrote a script to make them incrimental by saving last message id data

### custom keyboard driver:
- I want to extend my keyboard functionaity to change the lightup effect to highlight common keybind
- this is for a self challenge

### seemless car playlist predictor based off of measured traffic conditions (27):
- 

### screen watching password guesser(13):
- password guesser absed off of password input speed, trained off of watching the individals average wpm, and how specific words take different amounts of time to type
- this is deeply improbably, people type their passwords on average much quicker which would skew data

### build my own facial recognition and make it into a physical lock (29):
- opencv facial recognition

### manhunt app (31):
- attempt to network together multiple phones and assign one person as a hunter on a widescale map who can see the location of the other players
- have the map have an out of bounds ring to stop someone just goind a ridiculous distance, maybe have rulesets abou public transport etc

### crochet robot (32):
- should be able to take written patterns and use two articulate hands to produce the desired result
- making this purely out of spite

### polyglot file writer (33):
- polyglot files are files which have the structure be to able to change type when changing the extension without needing a converter
- when changing between pngs and txt for example it has the ability to hold content for both
- a app would need to be able to create the basic structure and have a panel to be able to mdify the contents of each type without constantly editing the extension

### Tsevhu language pond generator (37):
- a generator that can take a sentence and approximates it to work within the rules of Tsevhu, and then procedurally creates the koi pond image

### village agent simulation (40):
- simulated village days where each agent has to choose to go to different locations and simulate interactions with other agents, and recording their previous interactions etc
- see how long the simulation can run before breaking down incoherantly
