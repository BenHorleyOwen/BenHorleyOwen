# Things I want to make; (internal project numbers)

### personal selfhost website (11, 21, 22, 25, 26, 42):
- foundational project that I want to be able to run/host/showoff all my future creations through
- should contain a repository of all of the invention numbers, including noncode ones (which are excluded from here: 2,3,4,5,6,12,16,)

### receipt scan database for automated dietry information (23):
- create an agent which can scan through a reciept, check it against present spreadsheet entries and potentially keep moer whilst logging neutritional and spending habits.

### photodiode laser microphone (1):
- this is for the challenge of making it

### LED compass, integrated to calendar and google maps (7):
- this is for the challenge of making it

### Network access point house device room map (9, 11):
- devices typically connect to the strongest access point so a house with one in each room could have a map built based off network connection logs
- this could be further be improved by allowing things like music services which are tied to each device to follow someone around the house

### advanced bookshelf, ocr read into database, projector show on shelf (10):
- 

### external screenwatching password guesser, typing habit recreation (13):
- 

### drone swarm project (17, 39):
- 

### neural network trained off my own brain patterns as a foundation for other fun things (14, 28):
- 

### basic honeypot (18):
- nginx, ngrok, cowry docker container as a fake exposed ssh container

### keyboard driver to show keybind combos:
- 

### digial journal backup (20):
- 

### custom keyboard driver:
- I want to extend my keyboard functionaity to change the lightup effect to highlight common keybind
- this is for a self challenge

### seemless car playlist predictor based off of measured traffic conditions (27):
- 

### screen watching password guesser(13):
- password guesser absed off of password input speed, trained off of watching the individals average wpm, and how specific words take different amounts of time to type
- this is deeply improbably, people type their passwords on average much quicker which would skew data

### build my own facial recognition and make it into a physical lock (29):
- 

### manhunt app (31):
-

### crochet robot (32):
- should be able to take written patterns and use two articulate hands to produce the desired result
- making this purely out of spite

### polyglot file writer (33):
- polyglot files are files which have the structure be to able to change type when changing the extension without needing a converter
- when changing between pngs and txt for example it has the ability to hold content for both
- a app would need to be able to create the basic structure and have a panel to be able to mdify the contents of each type without constantly editing the extension

### Tsevhu language pond generator (37):
- a generator that can take a sentence and approximates it to work within the rules of Tsevhu, and then procedurally creates the koi pond image

### village agent simulation (40):
- 

### lab grown kitchen knife (43):
- if i  can lab grow diamonds into the edge of a kitchen knife it should take an extremely long time to dull so i wont have to worry about sharpening it
- if i want to go really overboard find a way to put ultrasonic vibration into it for even smoother prep

# Working on:

OCR library shelf assistant (10)

automated journal backup (36)
